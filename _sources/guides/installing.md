# Installing flow

The only prerequisite for installing Flow is Python itself. Python is available
for most operating systems, and downloads can be found at
https://www.python.org/downloads/, if a package is not available through a
native package manager.

Flow can be installed using `pip`, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install python-flow
```

Afterwards, can be imported as follows:

```py
import flow

print(flow.__version__)
```
