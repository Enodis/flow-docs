    "   again for another part of the same graph. \n",
    "2. It *configures the node*, if necessary. Some node require an initial\n",
    "   configuration, that may or may not be static throughout the execution.\n",
    "3. Instantiation may partially *connect the inputs* of a node, but this is not\n",

    "## Node views\n",

    "When a node has many input or output channels, it is sometimes useful to select\n",

    "Suppose you want to plot the left channel of a WAV file. You could do this in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a renamed view on `plot.line`:  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   wav.read(\"file.wav\") >> plot.line().view(values=\"left\")\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   \n",
    "   This works because the input of `plot.line` is called `values`, and the\n",
    "   channel is connected by name when there are multiple to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a renamed view on `wav.read`: \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   wav.read(\"file.wav\").view(left=\"values\") >> plot.line()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Same reason as (1).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Create a single output view on `wav.read`: \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   wav.read(\"file.wav\")[\"left\"] >> plot.line()\n",
    "   ```\n",
