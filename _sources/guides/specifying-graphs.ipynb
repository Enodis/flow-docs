    "   connected, and updated during execution. The same node may be instantiated\n",
    "   again for another part of the same graph. \n",
    "2. It *configures the node*, if necessary. Some node require an initial\n",
    "   configuration, that may or may not be static throughout the execution.\n",
    "3. Instantiation may partially *connect the inputs* of a node, but this is not\n",
    "   mandatory.\n",
